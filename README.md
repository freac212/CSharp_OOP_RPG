# CSharp OOP RPG ARENA!
A text based RPG written in C#. Initial commit source code is not mine.

## Description
This was a project in school to get us acquainted with C#. I took a bit further than the requirements 
by adding a UI system and various other smaller things. I plan to work on it a bit further later on, or scrap it completly.
You're a hero and you've been captured and trapped in an arena! You're doomed to fight enemies forever!
Although convniently enemies drop gold, and there's a shop available in between fights. Spend your
gold on better items, health potions, etc. There's three enemy difficulties to fight, Easy, Medium, and Hard.
Be careful of who you fight, there's only a slim chance of running away, and if you fail, they may just 
defeat you...

## Instructions
* Give the game your Heroes name, once it's locked in you'll be presented with the Home screen!
* Fight some enemies to increase your gold collection.
* Use that gold to buy Weapons, Armour, Shields and Potions in the shop.
* Weapons have a strength (Damage), which stacks on your current strength.
* Armour and Shields both add to your pre-exsiting defense as they stack just like strength.
* Potions (Currently only Health Potions) heal you by the amount of health it contains, does not heal over max health.
* You can gain achievements, they're kinda/ sorta secretive, but I'm sure you could find them easily. (Hint: They're all todo with Monster Kills ;D)
* One last very important thing, if your health goes below reaches or goes below 0, you die! And GameOver for that character, you'll just have to try your luck again with a new hero!
### Good Luck!
